Week 4: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project (Peer-graded Assignment)

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (UCI Data)

This repository is a es2275 part of Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It analyze Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones data set that has been donated by UCI. 

CodeBook.md is a code book that shows the work I did in order to complete the task and describes the variables and other key things to understand the assignemnt

run_analysis.R shows my codes based on the instruction given in the course. I 
merged the dataset given in this assign in order to create one data set for further analysis. I extracted the mean and standard deviation from the measurement given in the data set. In order to make it easier, I renamed the name of the dataset and label them with descriptive variable names. I also created a subsamplewith each variable and its means.
